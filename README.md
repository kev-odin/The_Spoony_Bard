Purpose

The purpose of this assignment is to apply all you have learned throughout the quarter to built a robust, object-oriented solution to a medium sized programming problem. You will have the opportunity to work in teams, refactor code, version your code, and maybe apply algorithms you have learned in TCSS 501. Successful completion of this program verifies your preparedness for TCSS 504.
Course Objectives this assignment meets
This assignment satisfies all 10 course objectives! Fitting of a final assignment for the course :-)

    C1: Use fundamental concepts of object-oriented design to write modular, extensible code
    C2: Use common design patterns to increase testability, readability, and maintainability of code
    C3: Apply skills to systematically test and debug applications
    C4: Recognize code smells and refactor code accordingly
    C5: Use data structures and algorithms from TCSS 501 in programming applications
    C6: Use the space time/characteristics of different search and sorting algorithms learned in TCSS 501 to choose the appropriate methods to implement.
    C7: Design, implement, document and debug a medium complexity program with an object hierarchy that includes interfaces and/or abstract classes and a graphical user interface, given some guidance on the design.
    C8: Design and implement unit tests for a medium complexity program with an object hierarchy that includes
    interfaces and/or abstract classes.
    C9: Utilize modern software engineering tools (e.g., IDEs, static checkers, unit testing frameworks, revision control systems) during the implementation of a medium complexity program.
    C10: Correctly employ programming language features by reading and interpreting the associated published API documentation.

Specifics

    For your final assignment in this course you will work in your teams to write a very small game.
    Details of the assignment are given in the pdf below.
    While it is not required, it is highly recommended you use git/GitHub to help coordinate your code base with your team members.
    We may try and do informal demonstrations of your project a day or two before the due date. If it is feasible, we can meet the Wednesday evening before all materials are due and each team can show off what they did.
